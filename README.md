# texlipse
The Texlipse Eclipse Plugin for LaTeX editing

This is an updated version of the good old [TexLipse plugin](http://sourceforge.net/projects/texlipse/).

The latest version from the original website does not completely work with newer eclipse versions, e.g. the "partial build" feature (very useful!).
I've rewritten some of the code so that this works okay with Eclipse up to mars.

You've got to install the plugin from within eclipse by building it yourself!
