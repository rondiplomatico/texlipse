# texlipse
The Texlipse Eclipse Plugin for LaTeX editing

This is an updated version of the good old [TexLipse plugin](http://sourceforge.net/projects/texlipse/).

The latest version from the original website does not completely work with newer eclipse versions, e.g. the "partial build" feature (very useful!).
I've rewritten some of the code so that this works okay with Eclipse up to mars.

# Install
Use the "dropins" folder: (Ganymede or newer)
 - Go to your eclipse installation folder
 - Create (any) subdirectory within
 - Unzip the texlipse-1.5.0.zip file there
 - Restart  Eclipse
 
Or: Build yourself! This requires the Eclipse PDE.
 - Go to "File" -> "Export"
 - Select "Deployable Plugins and Fragments"
 - Select "Install into host"
